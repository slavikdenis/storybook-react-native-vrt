## Versioning and Publishing packages

Package publishing has been configured using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Please review their [documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.

This example comes with automated npm releases setup in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action). To get this working, you will need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository settings. You should also install the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your GitHub repository as well.

For more information about this automation, refer to the official [changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/automating-changesets.md)
